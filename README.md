The video titled "May 11 2022 ACK Training Session" is a complete training session showing handler Edwin working with Persi and Madi while author/trainer Kayla assists.
The video titled "Visualizing an Extinction Burst" shows Persi make an off-target alert. The trainer clicks the moment that she sniffs the cheetah scat rather than waiting for a full alert.
The video titled "Persi Correct Dismissal" shows Persi correctly dismissing an off-target scat after investigating it, then making a correct alert to the cheetah sample. This video depicts the repetition directly following the video above.
